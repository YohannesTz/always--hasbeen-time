# Always has been
we tell time through the famous ** It alway has been ** meme. I was inspired when I was scrolling
over reddit and stumbled across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArduinoProjects/comments/i06i30/eink_clock/) post. I don't think it will help anyone but its a good troll material.

# Origin and background as explained [here](https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/always-has-been-memes/)
The earliest known iterations of the “always has been” meme originally [popped up on a 4chan board(duh!)](https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1533661215801.jpg) around 
August of 2018, according to [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wait-its-all-ohio-always-has-been), and involved crude MC-Paint style drawings. One version, which 
surged in popularity around late 2019, was [a spin on Ohio memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/IHateOhio/comments/e8tmev/fuck_fuck_fuck_fuck_its_all_ohio_shit/).
