# Always has been
we tell time through the famous ** It alway has been ** meme. I was inspired when I was scrolling
over reddit and stumbled across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArduinoProjects/comments/i06i30/eink_clock/) post.


# Origin and background as explained [here](https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/always-has-been-memes/)
The earliest known iterations of the “always has been” meme originally (popped up on a 4chan board(duh!))[https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1533661215801.jpg] around 
August of 2018, according to (Know Your Meme)[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wait-its-all-ohio-always-has-been], and involved crude MC-Paint style drawings. One version, which 
surged in popularity around late 2019, was (a spin on Ohio memes)[https://www.reddit.com/r/IHateOhio/comments/e8tmev/fuck_fuck_fuck_fuck_its_all_ohio_shit/].
